# Programming progress
# This file uses % to calculate how far we are with the project

# To do:
# - Think of a way to message the admin that there has been an change
# - Need to make every message unique (can we use a counter?)
# - Maybe a good idea to not use CSV but XML instead because it is easier to read in the code
# - Create a new rejected & accepted file every week followed by the weeknr&year (accepted-43-2016 etc.)
# - Create programs to test each aspect of the program -> create errorlog.txt with content like:
#   main -> Test Succes!
#   client -> Test Success!
#   admin -> Test failed! -> Errorcode + Message where it goes wrong
#   screen -> Test success!
#   Press any key to continue...
#   If error during running of the program -> print to file & show popup on screen containing an custom error code we created.
#   And notify the admin of this error.
